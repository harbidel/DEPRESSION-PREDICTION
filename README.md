# DEPRESSION-PREDICTION
The World Health Organization estimates that 1.3 million Kenyans suffer from untreated major depressive disorder (MDD; commonly known as depression) every year, and that sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of the illness of any region in the world. Yet mental health treatment in Kenya suffers from a lack of resources and stigmatization. There are only two certified psychiatrists per million people in Kenya. Few facilities exist outside of urban areas and people are unlikely to know about or access them. Can machine learning help alleviate this problem? Smart targeting of potential cases could help enable scarce resources to reach those who most need it and improve or save an untold number of lives.
